== Description ==
An updated Google Maps v3 mapping service (based on Semantic Maps v1.1 alpha) to overlay mapping resources accessible through ESRI ArcGIS Server v9.3+ REST API.

Check the patch file for differences (note: original was in Maps_1_1a directory).


==  Usage ==
This version creates 3 new mapping parameters:
* layer_url (url string)
* layer_click (boolean)
* layer_opacity (float between 0 & 1)

The layer parameters refer to mapping layer endpoints and their options.  The mapping layer endpoints will be overlayed over the Google Maps v3 map.

Examples:
{{#display_map: Denver, CO
| layer_url=http://maps.rtd-denver.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/SystemMapLiteGoogleVectors/MapServer
| layer_opacity=0.4
| zoom=13
}}

{{#display_points: Washington, DC
| layer_url=http://rmgsc.cr.usgs.gov/ArcGIS/rest/services/nhss_weat/MapServer
| layer_opacity=0.4
| zoom=5
}}

== Roadmap ==
Right now, it only works against ArcGIS v9.3+ RESTful services.  It currently validates the URL to the ArcGIS v9.3+ REST url pattern.  

In the future, it is intended to handle overlaying layers from other layer publishers.
