An updated Google Maps v3 mapping service (based on Semantic Maps v1.1 alpha) to overlay mapping resources accessible through ESRI ArcGIS Server v9.3+ REST API.

Check the patch file for differences (note: original was in Maps_1_1a directory).

This version creates 3 new mapping parameters:
* layer_url (url string)
* layer_click (boolean)
* layer_opacity (float between 0 & 1)

The layer parameters refer to mapping layer endpoints and their options.  The mapping layer endpoints will be overlayed over the Google Maps v3 map.

Right now, it only works against ArcGIS v9.3+ RESTful services.  It currently validates the URL to the ArcGIS v9.3+ REST url pattern.  

In the future, it is intended to handle overlaying layers from other layer publishers.
